# KCF tracker with Kalman filter

## What?

Here lies my university course project

## Why?

I had an idea to increase accuracy and robustness of a famous KCF tracker. And I thought maybe a Kalman filter can do its filtering thing and place a bounding box more accurately. But I didn't want to select parameters of Kalman filter by hand, so I implemented some sort of genetic algorithm to do it for me.

## What Algorithm?

I used generic Kalman filter algorithm. The state vector was as follows: (x1, y1,), where (x1, y1) - is the center of the bounding box.

Genetic algorithm selected elements for B, u, S, R and A matrices. I used f-measure with beta = 3 as a fitness function. Other parameters of the fitness function were accuracy and robustness. They were calculated plain VOT way, although I used DIOU instead of IOU, and omit less then 10 frames before calculation of the metrics.

## Where is the best genome?

## Some more details

Compiled and tested with OpenCV 4.2.0 

### How to load VOT2017 dataset

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/votchallenge/vot-toolkit-python
# if you have the same problem with numpy version that I did, then run this command:
# pip install numpy=1.21

mkdir vot2017
vot initialize vot2017 --workspace vot2017
# After loading process finishes, 
# you'll have directory with 60 sequences
```

### How to build and run

Build train code and test code
```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make -j4
```

```bash
# Start train

KCF
```

```bash
# Or run test on a webcam stream. 
# Genome already included in code (look at src/runtracker.cpp)

run_tracker

# When you run run_tracker, 
# press B and select BBox to track, than press Enter
```
